Chalkbox is a programming courses dream tool which allows the collection and 
running of multiple assignments in multiple languages.

Brief Feature List:

* None, we suck

## Who Uses Chalkbox

* No one, sad face

## How It Works

1. 

## Usage

### Commands

Chalkbox v2 has now introduced individual commands so that chalkbox can be
integrated into new development flows.


### Pipelines

Chalkbox v1 had support for box files which were the first iteration of 
pipelines. Pipelines integrate together tasks that you would need to perform 
to do a full chalkbox run. This is influenced greatly by modern CI/CD pipelines.

## Reports

Chalkbox is originally the creation of Brae Webb and Emily Bennett. Below is the
original work done on the first chalkbox.
